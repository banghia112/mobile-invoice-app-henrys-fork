# Mobile Invoice App - Henry's Fork

This repository contains a mobile invoice application built as a coding challenge. The application aims to demonstrate a structured development approach, from initial project setup to feature implementation and refinement.

## Work Progress

Here's a breakdown of the development journey for this mobile invoice application:

### Project Initialization and Core Setup

I kicked off the project by initializing it with **React Native Expo**. My immediate choice was **TypeScript**, primarily for its robust **type safety** and the excellent **coding conventions** it encourages. This decision was made early on to ensure a more maintainable and less error-prone codebase from the start.

### Navigation and Design System Foundations

With the project set up, I then focused on implementing the **basic navigation**. I started with **placeholder screens** to establish the general layout and create a skeletal structure for the app's flow. This allowed me to immediately begin developing **base components** for the **design system**, ensuring consistency and reusability across the application.

### Data Handling with AsyncStorage

To simulate network requests and handle local data persistence effectively, I chose to implement **AsyncStorage**. Its asynchronous nature made it an ideal candidate to replicate the behavior of fetching and storing data, mirroring how a real-world application would interact with a backend.

### Visual Consistency: Fonts and Colors

Following the design system, I integrated the specified **fonts and colors**. This step was crucial for ensuring the application's visual appeal and maintaining a consistent brand identity throughout all screens and components.

### Feature Implementation

With the foundational elements in place, I moved on to implementing the core features of the application. My priority here was to build with a focus on **good structure and maintainable code**. Each feature was developed with future scalability and ease of modification in mind.

### Refactoring and Optimization

Finally, a significant portion of the development cycle was dedicated to **refactoring**. This involved reviewing the entire codebase to ensure everything was "on point" â€“ optimizing performance, enhancing readability, addressing any technical debt, and making sure the application was robust and efficient.
